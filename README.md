1. Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?  
Version control lets you track changes in your code over time. It helps you go back to earlier versions if something breaks. GitHub is popular because it’s easy to use, supports team work, and helps manage versions online. It keeps your project safe and organized.

2. Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps, and what are some of the important decisions you must make during this process?  
To set up a new repository:  
1. Go to GitHub and click “New Repository.”  
2. Name your repo.  
3. Add a description (optional).  
4. Choose public or private.  
5. Decide if you want to add a README, .gitignore, or license.  
Key decisions: repo visibility (public/private) and what files to include at the start.

3. Discuss the importance of the README file in a GitHub repository. What should be included in a well-written README, and how does it contribute to effective collaboration? 
The README explains what the project is about. It helps others understand how to use or contribute. A good README includes:  
- Project name and purpose  
- How to install and run it  
- How to contribute  
- License info  
It makes teamwork easier by sharing key info up front.

4. Compare and contrast the differences between a public repository and a private repository on GitHub. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each, particularly in the context of collaborative projects? 
Public repository  
- Anyone can see it  
- Good for open-source projects  
- Can get help or feedback from anyone  
Private repository:  
- Only invited people can see it  
- Good for private or early-stage work  
- More control, but less open collaboration

5. Detail the steps involved in making your first commit to a GitHub repository. What are commits, and how do they help in tracking changes and managing different versions of your project? 
Steps:  
1. Make changes to your code  
2. Use `git add .` to stage the changes  
3. Use `git commit -m "Your message"` to commit  
4. Use `git push` to send it to GitHub  
Commits are saved points in your project’s history. They help you see what changed, when, and why.

6. How does branching work in Git, and why is it an important feature for collaborative development on GitHub? Discuss the process of creating, using, and merging branches in a typical workflow.  
Branching lets you work on new features or fixes without changing the main code.  
Steps:  
1. Create a branch: `git checkout -b new-feature`  
2. Make changes and commit  
3. Merge it back: open a pull request, then merge  
This keeps the main branch safe and clean while work is being done.

7. Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request? 
Pull requests (PRs) let you ask to merge code from one branch to another.  
Steps:  
1. Push your branch  
2. Click “New pull request” on GitHub  
3. Add a title and description  
4. Ask teammates to review  
5. After approval, merge it  
PRs allow code review, feedback, and better teamwork.

---

8. Discuss the concept of "forking" a repository on GitHub. How does forking differ from cloning, and what are some scenarios where forking would be particularly useful?  
Forking copies someone else’s repo to your GitHub account.  
Cloning copies a repo to your computer.  
Use forking when you want to contribute to someone else’s project without changing their original code. You can fork, make changes, and send a pull request.

9. Examine the importance of issues and project boards on GitHub. How can they be used to track bugs, manage tasks, and improve project organization? Provide examples of how these tools can enhance collaborative efforts. 
Issues* help track bugs, features, and tasks.  
Project board organize work using cards and columns (like To Do, Doing, Done).  
Example: Use issues to report bugs and assign them to team members. Use a board to track progress. These tools make teamwork clearer and more efficient.

10. Reflect on common challenges and best practices associated with using GitHub for version control. What are some common pitfalls new users might encounter, and what strategies can be employed to overcome them and ensure smooth collaboration?  
Common challenges. 
- Merge conflicts  
- Forgetting to commit or push  
- Not writing clear commit messages  
Best practices:
- Commit often  
- Use branches  
- Write helpful commit messages  
- Communicate with your team  
These habits help avoid problems and keep the team on the same page.
